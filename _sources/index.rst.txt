Welcome to **tfilterspy**'s documentation!
-----------------------------------------



TFiltersPy is your new favorite Python library for implementing state-of-the-art Bayesian filtering techniques like Kalman Filters and Particle Filters. 
Whether you're working on noisy linear systems, nonlinear dynamics, or want to sound cool at a party when you say "I coded my own Kalman Filter," this is the library for you!

Features
--------
- **Kalman Filtering:** Robust state estimation with uncertainty quantification.
- **Particle Filtering:** Non-linear and non-Gaussian filtering methods.
- **Distributed Computation:** Leveraging Dask for scalability.
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Built-in methods for assessing estimation confidence.

Installation
============

Getting started with **tfilterspy** is as easy as pie (or Pi)! üç∞

No need for complicated rituals or secret handshakes‚Äîjust open your terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install tfilterpy

That‚Äôs it! In a flash, you‚Äôre all set to start filtering out the noise from your data.

Prefer to tinker under the hood? If you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, clone the repo and install it in editable mode:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/LeparaLaMapara/tfilterspy.git
    cd tfilterspy
    pip install -e .

Now, let the magic of Bayesian filtering begin! Enjoy the fun of transforming noisy data into clear insights with **tfilterspy**.
