**tfilterpy** is a Python package for state estimation using Bayesian filtering techniques such as Kalman and Particle Filters.
It supports distributed computing with Dask, allowing you to process large datasets efficiently.

Features
--------
- **Kalman Filtering:** Robust state estimation with uncertainty quantification.
- **Particle Filtering:** Non-linear and non-Gaussian filtering methods.
- **Distributed Computation:** Leveraging Dask for scalability.
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Built-in methods for assessing estimation confidence.

Quick Start
-----------
